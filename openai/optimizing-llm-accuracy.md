# Optimizing LLM Accuracy

Maximize correctness and consistent behavior when working with LLMs.

## Introduction

Optimizing LLMs is challenging for several key reasons:
- Knowing how to start optimizing accuracy
- When to use what optimization method
- What level of accuracy is good enough for production

This guide provides a mental model for optimizing LLMs for accuracy and behavior, exploring methods like prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning.

## Understanding the Context

Before diving into optimization, consider:
- The cost of LLM failures for your use case
- The value of LLM successes
- The difference between minor errors (e.g., fixable copy) vs. critical errors (e.g., incorrect refunds)

## LLM Optimization Framework

Rather than following a linear optimization flow, think of LLM optimization as a matrix with two key axes:

### Context Optimization
Needed when:
1. Model lacks contextual knowledge from training
2. Knowledge is outdated
3. Proprietary information is required

### LLM Optimization
Needed when:
1. Inconsistent results or incorrect formatting
2. Incorrect tone or style
3. Inconsistent reasoning patterns

## Optimization Methods

### 1. Prompt Engineering

**Why Start Here:**
- Often sufficient for tasks like summarization, translation, and code generation
- Forces clear definition of accuracy requirements
- Helps identify specific optimization needs

**Optimization Strategies:**

| Strategy | Context Optimization | LLM Optimization |
|----------|---------------------|------------------|
| Write clear instructions | | X |
| Split complex tasks | X | X |
| Give GPTs time to "think" | | X |
| Test changes systematically | X | X |
| Provide reference text | X | |
| Use external tools | X | |

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG is the process of retrieving content to augment your LLM's prompt before generating an answer.

**Key Components:**
1. Knowledge base embedding
2. Question embedding and retrieval
3. Context-enhanced prompt generation

**RAG Evaluation Matrix:**

| Area | Problem | Resolution |
|------|----------|------------|
| Retrieval | Wrong context or information overload | - Tune search relevance<br>- Reduce noise<br>- Enhance retrieved content |
| LLM | Incorrect processing of correct context | - Improve instructions<br>- Add examples<br>- Consider fine-tuning |

### 3. Fine-tuning

**Primary Uses:**
1. Improve accuracy on specific tasks
2. Enhance model efficiency

**Best Practices:**
- Start with prompt engineering baseline
- Focus on quality over quantity (start with 50+ examples)
- Ensure training data matches production scenarios
- Include RAG examples if using RAG in production

## Evaluation Framework

### Business Evaluation Example

| Event | Value | Number of Cases | Total Value |
|-------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| AI Success | +$20 | 815 | $16,300 |
| AI Failure (Escalation) | -$40 | 175.75 | $7,030 |
| AI Failure (Churn) | -$1000 | 9.25 | $9,250 |
| **Result** | | | **+$20** |
| Break-even Accuracy | | | 81.5% |

### Technical Evaluation

Key metrics to track:
- CSAT scores (AI vs. human)
- Decision accuracy
- Resolution time
- Error rates and types

## Production Readiness

### Determining "Good Enough" Accuracy

Consider:
1. Business impact of errors
2. Cost of human intervention
3. Customer experience requirements
4. Operational savings
5. Risk tolerance

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. Confidence-based escalation
2. Multi-step verification
3. Human oversight for critical cases
4. Graceful degradation paths

## Best Practices for Implementation

1. Start simple with prompt engineering
2. Add complexity (RAG, fine-tuning) only when needed
3. Maintain comprehensive evaluation sets
4. Monitor production performance
5. Have clear escalation paths
6. Regular model and retrieval updates

## Measuring Success

Track these key metrics:
- Accuracy rates
- User satisfaction
- Resolution times
- Cost savings
- Error rates
- Escalation rates
- System performance

Remember: The goal is not perfect accuracy, but rather achieving business objectives while managing risks effectively.
